NIPS.\n**Type**: Literature Note\n**Status**: Complete\n\n## Summary\nIntroduces the Transformer architecture, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely and relying only on attention mechanisms.\n\n## Key Points\n\n### Architecture\n- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: 6 layers each\n- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel attention mechanisms\n- **Position Encoding**: Sinusoidal functions for sequence order\n- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Point-wise fully connected layers\n\n### Attention Mechanism\n> \"Attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output\"\n\n**Formula**: $\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\n\n### Results\n- **Translation**: State-of-the-art on WMT 2014 En-De and En-Fr\n- **Training Time**: Significantly faster than RNNs\n- **Parallelization**: Better GPU utilization\n\n## Personal Notes\nThis paper revolutionized NLP by showing attention alone is sufficient.
